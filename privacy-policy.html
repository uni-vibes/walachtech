      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Uni Vibes (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information that you provide and information generated by your use of the App.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Account and profile information</b> (such as your name/display name, campus/university, course if provided, interests, and profile photos).</li>
        <li><b>Content and activity</b> (such as posts, comments, likes, messages, and call-related records required to provide calling features).</li>
        <li><b>Device and technical information</b> (such as a notification token used to deliver push notifications and basic app/device data for reliability and security).</li>
        <li><b>Payment information</b> (purchases are processed by Google Play Billing; we do not store your full payment card details).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App and its features.</li>
        <li>Create and manage accounts and profiles.</li>
        <li>Support safety features (such as blocking/reporting and abuse prevention).</li>
        <li>Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve performance and reliability.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about the service (for example, service-related notifications).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Sharing of information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal information.
        We may share information with service providers that help us operate the App (for example, hosting, storage, notifications, and payment processing),
        and when required by law or to protect users, the public, and the App.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate operational and safety purposes.
        If you delete your account, we aim to delete your profile and associated data. Some information may remain for a limited period due to backups,
        legal obligations, or technical constraints.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Uni Vibes is intended for university students and alumni. If you are under 18, you should only use the App with appropriate guardian consent
        where required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        You may be able to access, update, or delete certain information through your account.
        For account deletion options, see the Account Deletion page.
      </p>
